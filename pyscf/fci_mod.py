fci_mod.py

Helpful funcs for using pySCF, pyblock3
Imports are within functions since some machines can run only pyblock3 or pyscf

pyscf/fci module:
- configuration interaction solvers of form fci.direct_x.FCI()
- diagonalize 2nd quant hamiltonians via the .kernel() method
- .kernel takes (1e hamiltonian, 2e hamiltonian, # spacial orbs, (# alpha e's, # beta e's))
- direct_nosym assumes only h_pqrs = h_rspq (switch r1, r2 in coulomb integral)
- direct_spin1 assumes h_pqrs = h_qprs = h_pqsr = h_qpsr
